        "text":"My Foolish Heart was one of the songs that got me into the American Songbook. I did not grow up around music like this. I discovered it later. The Bill Evans version from 1961 is gorgeous. The open string bass notes ringing out beneath heart-clenching diminished and diminished major-7 chords. Really beautiful and inspiring. My approach to this song is based off of his. Lots of diminished and altered dominant chords during the maudulin section setting up the bright happyish ending.",

        "text":"This is not one of my favorite songs. Every single singer makes it sound boring. The lyrics are okay. It was the instrumentalists that got me into this one. Those who really get creative with the harmony can make the melody pop out of the background. It is a love song so playing different kinds of chords can change the way the performance is felt. That is when I think this song is most powerful.",

        "text":"Sometimes I do songs that people don't see coming. This is probably one of them. It is an Elvis Costello song. But it was played a lot by Chet Baker and more recently Elvis Costello's wife, Diana Krall. So it isn't exactly unknown in the jazz world. I tried to make the chords as interesting as possible. It is such a long and slow song though that there isn't really enough time for an improsived solo through a second time. But who says that you can't just play the song as it is and end it?",

        "text":"This is one of those songs that is both fun to play and easy to listen to. It seems to be hard to mess it up because so many musicians and singers do a great job with this tune. I decided to play a short improsived intro. I was singing in my head \"Isn't it romantic, isn't it romantic...\" before launching into the melody. Instead of playing an improvised solo for the second time through in the same key, I key change and it sounds really fresh to me. The song is simply constructed with genius. I tried to bring us back to my original key to finish it.",

This is a Sinatra song and my family likes it. It is kind of that simple. Personally, I like the Linda Ronstadt version more than his too.",

It seems all the big time singers and instrumentalists alike love this song. Such a surprising yet inviting key change to the viMajor in bar 9. I can ramble on forever about the genius here but I will say this: playing this song is a delight and it is in my permanent repertoire.",

It was created by trained professional musicians who knew exactly what they were doing. Many arias are composed like proto-20th century tunes and the first part of Una Voce Poco Fa is one. You can treat it like a jazz standard and that is what I did here.",
