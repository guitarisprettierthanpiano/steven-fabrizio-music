        <h1>ABOUT CLOUD TASTER</h1>

        The vibrations of the strings. The sustained ringing of the sound holes. Even the smell of wood polish. This is why I can't leave this instrument alone.

        This album is just a man with his guitar. Nothing written out and pre-planned. Play through the song once and a second time very freely. Improvise the entire thing. I added a tiny bit of reverb and that is it.

        This whole Covid-19 thing gave me the time to really sit down and work on my weaknesses on the instrument. It is a tricky instrument that only spending a lot of time with it can you get comfortable with it's peculiarities. Learning to improvise over a song's structure is such a pleasure.

        The songs I've picked here for some reason or another have stuck to me.
