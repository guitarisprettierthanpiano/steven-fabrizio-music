The vibrations of the strings. The sustained ringing of the sound holes. Even the smell of wood polish. This is why I can't leave the guitar alone. It is such a blessing to be able to play personally satisfying music on an instrument.

There isn't a reason for picking the songs that I did. I know a lot of songs but these came out when I sat down ready to play. I thought of keys I hadn't yet played in and picked songs that sound good in those keys. Enjoy the album!
